In World AI Findings

	I downloaded the InworldAI from my unity assets and imported it into a new project in Unity. I tested out the microphone and sample Innequin scene. I thought it was very interesting, haha. My Innequin gave me some attitude. I took screenshots, but I could not upload due to no link provided.
